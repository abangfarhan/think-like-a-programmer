 *To make the ciphertext problem even more challenging, have your program
 *randomly generate the cipher array instead of a hard-coded const array.
 *Effectively, this means placing a random character in each element of the
 *array, but remember that you can’t substitute a letter for itself. So the first
 *element can’t be A, and you can’t use the same letter for two substitutions—
 *that is, if the first element is S, no other element can be S.
